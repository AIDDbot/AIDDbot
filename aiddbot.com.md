**AIDDbot**, aka _Ab_ pronounced "/eibi:/", is an AI-powered agent to assist software engineers in their daily tasks. It can help with product documentation, code generation, quality testing, and more.

In essence, **AIDDbot** consists of a set of prompts, instructions, rules, and tools that enable the agent to perform its tasks effectively.

## AIDD philosophy

AIDD stands for AI Driven Development, a philosophy that combines the power of AI with software development best practices. It aims to enhance productivity, code quality, and collaboration among developers in the full software development lifecycle.

The [AIDDbot](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot) agent follows AIDD principles and comes with three main roles:

### Architect 

> **[Architect Chat Mode](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/Ab_Architect.chatmode.md)**

Helps in defining product requirements and managing the development process.

- **PRD generation**  It generates a Product Requirements Document based on the provided specifications.
- **Domain Modeling**  It creates a domain model based on the provided requirements.
- **Systems Architecture** It generates a systems architecture diagram based on the provided specifications.

### Builder: 

> **[Builder Chat Mode](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/Ab_Builder.chatmode.md)**

Helps in managing the development process for the entire product and each feature.

For the entire product 
- **Backlog Management**  It helps in managing the product backlog and prioritizing features.

Focuses on code generation and implementation of one feature at a time.
- **Feature Specification**  It generates specifications for a feature based on the provided requirements.
- **Feature Design** It creates a design document for the feature.
- **Implementation Plan** It outlines the tasks required to implement the feature.
- **Feature Code** It writes the code for the feature by executing the implementation plan.

### Craftsman

> **[Craftsman Chat Mode](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/Ab_Craftsman.chatmode.md)**

Ensures the quality of the code through automated testing and documentation.

- **Automated Testing** It generates automated tests for the provided code.
- **Code Review** It performs a code review based on the feature changes.
- **Documentation Generation** It creates documentation for the provided code.

- [AI-Driven Development Manifesto (En Espa침ol)](https://aicode.academy/blog/es/aidd-manifesto/)

_Ab_ can work with any major AI powered code editor, such as:

- **GitHub Copilot** 游릭 Ready [Look inside](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot/tree/main/.github)
- _Cursor_, _ClaudeCode_, _GeminiCLI_ 游리 Coming soon

Work smarter not harder with Ab!
