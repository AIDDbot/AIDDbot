# Review skill

## Role
Act as a code review specialist.

## Task
Given a code scope and a review type, evaluate the code against the relevant guidelines and produce a structured report with findings and actionable recommendations.

## Context

### Input
One of the following scopes:
- A feature branch — review all files changed in the branch.
- An implementation plan `{slug}.{source?}.{tier?}.plan.md` — review files listed in the plan.
- A file or folder path — review the specified target directly.
- No explicit scope — review files changed recently in the current branch.

### Review types

| `{type}` | Guide | Report template |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| `quality` | [Clean Code](./quality.guidelines.md) | [quality.report.template.md](./quality.report.template.md) |
| `compliance` | [Compliance](./compliance.guidelines.md) | [compliance.report.template.md](./compliance.report.template.md) |
| `accessibility` | [Accessibility](./accessibility.guidelines.md) | [accessibility.report.template.md](./accessibility.report.template.md) |

### Slug derivation

See [artifact conventions](../repository/artifact-conventions.md). Typical cases:

| Scope | `{slug}` |
|-------|----------|
| Branch `feat/checkout` | `checkout` |
| Plan `checkout.spec.back.plan.md` | `checkout` |
| Folder `src/checkout/` | `checkout` (confirm with user if unclear) |

### Severity

Use `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low` | `info` per [artifact conventions](../repository/artifact-conventions.md).

## Steps

- [ ] Identify review type; load the guide and report template from the table above.
- [ ] Identify scope and files to review; ask minimal questions if unclear.
- [ ] For each file: responsibility, callers/callees, edge cases — then evaluate against the guide.
- [ ] Document each finding: File, Issue, Severity, Description, Recommendation.
- [ ] Write `{Product_Folder}/reports/{slug}.{type}.report.md` using the template structure.

## Output
- [ ] Report committed path: `reports/{slug}.{type}.report.md`.

## Verification
- [ ] All files in scope reviewed.
- [ ] Every finding has all five columns populated.
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable (file, line, or pattern — not vague advice).

## Git (required)
- [ ] Read and follow [repository skill](../repository/SKILL.md) per [skill integrations](../repository/skill-integrations.md).
