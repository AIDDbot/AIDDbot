| [`/planify`](./skills/planify/) | Implementation plans from spec |
| [`/codify`](./skills/codify/) | Code and unit tests from plans |

|-------|----------------|
| [`/review`](./skills/review/) | Audit a11y, security, performance; fix findings in place |

## Typical loops

**Greenfield (once):** `/establish` → `/explore` → `/elaborate` (per tier, then `ER.md`)

**Brownfield (once):** `/establish` → `/explore` → `/excavate` (per tier, then `ER.md`) → `/extract` (per tier) 

**Feature:** /specify → /planify → /codify → /verify → /review? → /refactor? → /release

**Failed verification:**  `/verify` → `/rectify`
