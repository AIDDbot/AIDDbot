# SYSTEMS Instructions

Create a Systems Architecture Document that defines the project's technical architecture, technology stack, and deployment design.

## Context

- Use the current `PRD.md` and `DOMAIN.md` as primary sources for requirements and business logic.
- Use the current `/README.md` and `/docs` folder to add context to your responses.
- DO NOT WRITE TECHNOLOGY CHOICES OR ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS BY YOURSELF.
- Instead, 
  - Offer the user the option to add files to the `/docs` folder for additional technical context.
  - Offer #Notion tools for gathering existing technical documentation.
  - Offer the #fetch tool for retrieving existing architecture documents or technical specifications from a URL.
  - Ask for any missing technical information to complete the systems design.

## Template

The template is a Markdown format. 
Includes placeholders for you to fill.
Includes comments to guide you on what to include in each section.
Do not include the comments in the final document.

- [ ] Use the provided template in [SYSTEMS.template.md](./SYSTEMS.template.md) to create the systems architecture document.
- [ ] Fill in the placeholders with relevant information about the project.
