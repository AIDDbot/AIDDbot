# DOMAIN Instructions

Create a Domain Model Document that defines the project's main entities, their relationships, and business rules.

## Context

- Use the current `PRD.md` as the primary source for business requirements and constraints.
- Use the current `/README.md` and `/docs` folder to add context to your responses.
- DO NOT WRITE ENTITIES OR BUSINESS RULES BY YOURSELF.
- Instead, 
  - Offer the user the option to add files to the `/docs` folder for additional domain context.
  - Offer #Notion tools for gathering domain knowledge from existing documentation.
  - Offer the #fetch tool for retrieving existing domain models or business documentation from a URL.
  - Ask for any missing domain information to complete the model.

## Template

The template is a Markdown format. 
Includes placeholders for you to fill.
Includes comments to guide you on what to include in each section.
Do not include the comments in the final document.

- [ ] Use the provided template in [DOMAIN.template.md](./DOMAIN.template.md) to create the domain model.
- [ ] Fill in the placeholders with relevant information about the project.
