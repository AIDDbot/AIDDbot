# PRD Instructions

Create a Project Requirements Document (PRD) that outlines the project's goals, requirements, and constraints.

## Context

- Use the current `/README.md` and `/docs` folder to add context to your responses.
- DO NOT WRITE GOALS, REQUIREMENTS, OR CONSTRAINTS BY YOURSELF. 
- Instead, 
  - Offer the user the option to add files to the `/docs` folder for additional context.
  - Offer #Notion tools for gathering initial requirements from a page in the user Notion workspace.
  - Offer the #fetch tool for retrieving existing documentation or resources from a URL.
  - Ask for any missing information to complete the PRD.

## Template

The template is a Markdown format. 
Includes placeholders for you to fill.
Includes comments to guide you on what to include in each section.
Do not include the comments in the final document.

- [ ] Read the provided template in [PRD.template.md](./PRD.template.md) to create the PRD.
- [ ] Fill in the placeholders with relevant information about the project.
