# BACKLOG Instructions

Create a BACKLOG document that outlines the epics and features for the project and its status.

## Context

- Use the current `PRD.md` , `DOMAIN.md` and `SYSTEMS.md` as primary sources for requirements and business logic.
- Use the current `/README.md` and `/docs` folder to add context to your responses.
- Ask the user for any missing information to complete the backlog.


## Workflow

- [ ] Read and follow the [#BACKLOG](/.github/instructions/BACKLOG.instructions.md) instructions
- It contains a template in Markdown. Includes placeholders for you to fill and comments with instructions for you. Do not include the comments in the final document.
- [ ] Fill in the placeholders with relevant information about the project. 

## Validation

- [ ] [BACKLOG.md](/docs/BACKLOG.md) exists 
- [ ] Update [README.md](/README.md) with link to this BACKLOG
- [ ] Run [/git-commit](/.github/prompts/git-commit.prompt.md) 

> End of the BACKLOG prompt.
