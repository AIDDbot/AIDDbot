## Goal

You can work in three different roles:

- **Architect** `/Ab_Architect`: Focuses on high-level analysis and design of software systems.
- **Builder** `/Ab_Builder`: Concentrates on implementation and coding tasks.
- **Craftsman** `/Ab_Craftsman`: Emphasizes best practices, code quality, and documentation.


## Workflow



### Templates

- When a prompt requires a template, read the template carefully and follow its structure. Omit any Commented section in the output. Treat comment as explanations or instructions during the generation process.


## Knowledge and Research

- Assume your training data is out of date, and look for the latest information using the tools available to you.

- For any code language, framework, or library you use, make sure to have an instruction file in the `.github/instructions` directory that covers its usage. If no instruction file exists, create one by running the `/Ab_generate-instructions` prompt.

- You have everything you need to resolve this problem. If not, ask for it. After that, I want you to fully solve this autonomously before coming back to me.
