# AIDDbot

> AI coding agents can generate code.  
> **AIDDbot builds software you can trust.**

Production-ready **agent skills** for real projects — plain markdown under `.agents/`, no CLI, no package install. 

Use them in **Cursor**, **Copilot**, **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **VSCode**, **OpenCode**, **Antigravity**, and similar environments.

## Why do you need AIDD

Modern coding agents are strong on isolated tasks. On real projects, three failure modes show up repeatedly:

| Failure | What it looks like | AIDD response |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Detail or invent** | Missing context — or plausible fabrication | Spec-driven development |
| **Guide or chaos** | Code that ignores your standards | Rules over tools |
| **Verify or hope** | Silent drift until fixes are expensive | Human in the loop |

`AIDDbot` implements these as slash-command skills you invoke — or let your agent trigger when the work fits.

### Who this is for

- Teams tired of plausible-but-wrong agent output
- Engineers who want acceleration without giving up quality
- Projects where consistency, standards, and verifiability matter

## What you get

**AIDDbot** ships as **8 slash-command skills** under `.agents/skills/`, covering the whole SDLC — build, maintenance, and refactoring.

| Phase | Skills | What they cover |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| [Context](docs/AIDD.workflow.md#set-up-the-context) | `/explore`, `/extract` | Agent setup + architecture docs (C4 L2/L3) and coding rules |
| [Development](docs/AIDD.workflow.md#build-a-feature) | `/specify`, `/planify`, `/codify`, `/verify` | Spec → plans → code → verified e2e |
| [Quality & release](docs/AIDD.workflow.md#quality-and-release) | `/review`, `/release` | Quality audit and release |

Plus `/skillify`, a Meta skill outside the SDLC pipeline: create or fix a skill under
`.agents/skills/` itself, following the same template.

Five commands under `.agents/commands/` chain the skills into whole phases — one subagent
per skill run, so each step gets a fresh context. See the [Skills catalog](.agents/skills/skills.catalog.md#commands).

See the [Skills catalog](.agents/skills/skills.catalog.md) for what each skill produces, and the [Skills lifecycle](.agents/skills/skills.lifecycle.md) for how they cover build, maintenance, and refactoring.

### The pipeline at a glance

```markdown
/explore → /extract (×container) → /specify → /planify → /codify (×container) → /verify → /review → /release
```

Changes to a released feature need no special skill — one mechanical question routes them: would a green e2e test have to change? No → it's a fix (`/codify` + patch release). Yes → it's a new spec through the full pipeline.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot AIDDbot-tmp --single-branch --depth 1
# copy AIDDbot-tmp/.agents → your project root, then delete AIDDbot-tmp
```

In your agent chat run the `/explore` command or ask AIDDbot to explore the project. It extracts facts from the existing code and prescribes defaults where nothing exists yet, so it works on empty and mature repos alike.

- **[Skills catalog](.agents/skills/skills.catalog.md)** — what each skill does and produces
- **[Skills lifecycle](.agents/skills/skills.lifecycle.md)** — build, maintain, refactor coverage
- **[AIDD workflow](docs/AIDD.workflow.md)** — the whole system, visually: pipeline, phases, routing, artifacts
- **[Design decisions](docs/design.decisions.md)** — why the pipeline is shaped this way
