## ❓ What is AIDDbot?

**It is an AI-powered assistant for software engineers**  that helps with:

- product design and system architecture, 
- code generation following spec-driven development, 
- testing and documentation for maintenance.

## ⚙️ How does it work?

**Enhances gitHub Copilot** with a set of:

- prompts,
- instructions,
- chat modes.

## 🎯 Why do you need AIDDbot?

**To develop large and complex projects**, which pose a challenge for LLMs due to:

- memory limitations in providing _context_,
- _hallucinations_ from training deficiencies, and
- the need to maintain _consistency_ over time.

## 🚀 Where to start?

**Works with GitHub Copilot under any IDE and over any LLM** only need to copy the `.github` folder to your project.

## 💭 AIDD Philosophy

**AIDD** (AI-Driven Development) blends AI capabilities with established software engineering practices to boost productivity, code quality, and collaboration across the full lifecycle.

The `AIDDbot` agent adheres to the three [AIDD Manifesto](https://aiddbot.com/aidd-manifesto) principles:

- **🧑‍💻 Human in the Loop**: Your work becomes more strategic, collaborative, and accountable.
- **🔧 Rules over Tools**: Tools are just means; but rules & processes provide durable value.
- **✅ AI Quality**: Not only higher productivity, but also maintainable, high-quality software.

Those principles are implemented by three roles:

- **🧑‍💼 Architect**: Focuses on high-level design and system architecture.
- **👷 Builder**: Concentrates on implementation and coding tasks.
- **🧑‍🔧 Craftsman**: Ensures quality through testing and refinement.

And lastly, it follows the technical best practices of:

- **📒 Spec-Driven Development**: Focuses on defining clear specifications before implementation.
- **📝 Prompt Engineering**: Involves crafting effective prompts to guide AI behavior.
- **📚 Context Engineering**: Ensures relevant context is provided to the AI for better responses.
