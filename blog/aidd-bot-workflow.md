## AI Driven Development

### State Of The Art

### Challenges

- Scope.

- Hallucination: AI models may generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.

- Degradation: Over time, AI models may lose accuracy as the chat window progresses.

### Solution

- Divide and conquer: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks that can be tackled individually.

- Use file system as a memory for long-term context and information retention.

- Context Engineering: Develop techniques to create, manage, and utilize context effectively throughout the development process.
